# Proximity-Lock
An Android application that turns the screen off when the proximity sensor is covered.

The idea of this app is based on the app "BSOL: The Black Screen of Life" which accomplished pretty much the same thing. Proximity Lock has no customization in terms of screen-off timer or vibration when the screen turns off. However, it does not run ads which is the main reason for my creation of the app.

Note: This is a very simple app and has not really been tested for bugs. I mostly created it for my personal use on my Samsung Galaxy S8.
